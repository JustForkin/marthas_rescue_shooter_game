# Introduction

This is the basis of my work, where I wrote down everything I planned for this project since the start of it. Keep in mind that I tried building everything that's written here in just 5 days, but things could have taken a different turn or not everything was completed in the first release.

# Story

## Intro

The year is 1943, we are in the middle of World War II. Our story's heroine is Martha, a 25 years old British pilot. She works for a secret agency, where she learned everything about battle planes to take undercover missions against german air forces. Two days ago, her father, a British general, was kidnapped by the Germans and is being held captive in their western stronghold.

Enraged at this news, Martha is on a mission to rescue her father by breaching each of the 5 main west command posts, where she will find clues on how to breach through the command post in which her father is located.

Now everything depends on you, the player, to guide her in this journey, but don't worry, the agency will help you with any means necessary each time you take down a post commander. Good luck!
