# Introduction

This is the basis of my work, where I wrote down everything I planned for this project since the start of it. Keep in mind that I tried building everything that's written here in just 5 days, but things could have taken a different turn or not everything was completed in the first release.

# Story

The year is 1943, we are in the middle of World War II. Our story's protagonist is Martha, a 25 years old British pilot. She works for a secret agency, where she learned everything about battle planes and goes on secret missions against german air forces.

Two days ago, her father, a British general, was kidnapped by them and is being held captive in their western stronghold.
After finding out about this, Martha will try rescuing her father by destroying each of the 9 main west command posts, where she will collect clues about how to breach through the one her father is.

Now everything depends on you (the player) to guide her in this journey, but don't worry, the agency will help you with any means necessary each time you take down a commander.
